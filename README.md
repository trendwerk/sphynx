# Sphynx

A light & simple WordPress starter theme.

## Installation

If you're using Composer (and you should), you can start your project based on Sphynx with the command below.
```
composer create-project trendwerk/sphynx <folder>
```

### Customizing
Sphynx is built to be customized. Run `npm install` and start building!

### Timber
Sphynx heavily relies on the [Timber](http://upstatement.com/timber/) plugin by Upstatement for using Twig as a template engine.

## Development tools

Sphynx uses the following development tools and preprocessors to make our lives easier.

### Preprocessors

**Sass** - We use Sass as a CSS preprocessor. More info: http://sass-lang.com/

### Transpilers

**Babel** Used to transpile ES2015 to ES5 JavaScript so all browsers get it. See https://babeljs.io/

### Development tools

**Gulp** - Sphynx uses the task manager “Gulp” to automatically compile Sass and CoffeeScript and to perform some other automated tasks. More info: http://gulpjs.com/

To use Gulp, just use terminal to navigate to your theme root folder and type `gulp`. The first time you use Gulp on your project you should use the `npm install` command first.

**NPM** - Sphynx uses Node Package manager to manage Node.js dependencies for Gulp. More info: https://www.npmjs.com/

**Bower** - Bower is used to manage front-end dependencies. More info: http://bower.io/
